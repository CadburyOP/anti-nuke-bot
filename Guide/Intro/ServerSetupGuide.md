## Server Setup 
### Things to do
##### #1:
> - Put your bot's role above all the roles so it can have ability to manage everyone 

##### #2:
> - Make sure your bot has administrator permissions so it can manage other members having the same permission

##### #3:
> - Enable the antinuke in your server by this command: `(prefix)antinuke enable`

##### #4:
> - Make sure to run the `trust` command on your admins & bots. The usage is `(prefix)trust @user`; to know more about this command, just send `(prefix)trust`
