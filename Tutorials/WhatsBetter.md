## Which mode is better - Limit Mode or Trust Mode?
Personally i like limit mode because there are no bugs so far, and it is good to set limits rather than setting the most strict mode (trust mode). 
### ...bugs?
Limit Mode's known bugs to me:
- `,set all` command doesn't work (doesn't affect in any way tho)
- `,reset all` command doesn't work (this too doesn't affect in any way)

Trust Mode's known bugs to me:
- trust mode is not good to use on replit for non-hacker users due to an [issue]().

### what's the issue in trust mode?
suppose you created a trusted list by trusting some users. in the next 24 hours the list will become shorter or it will get cleared automatically. this bug happens to **non-hacker** replit users. free replit users have a problem that their repls lose data. i found [this post](https://blog.replit.com/replspace-filesystems), it might help u know more about it.

### So at last, what should i use?
it depends on you & your likings. i recommend you to use limit mode if you want no issues if you don't have replit hacker plan. Or, you can use a VPS to run Trust Mode of antinuke without any issues i guess. So at last i wanna say that... use Limit mode if u dont want to spend a single penny or it's your choice.
